# Values

Random reminder of one of your values

## TODOs:

- Confirmation when deleting?
  - modal or, when you click it, it gets bigger and redder, you have to click it 3 times
- nav bar for the buttons?
- Hide the contents
- datesAccessed
- keywords

### Design
- find a design/layout that I like
  - cool form title that move

at the end: rename everything to Reminders instead of Values?

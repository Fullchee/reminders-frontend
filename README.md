# [Reminders](https://fullchee-reminders.netlify.app/)

Shows a random piece of media that reminded me of who I want to be.

In the day-to-day grind, it's easy to forget what's important.

I've also started using this as a spaced repetition tool (like Anki) for YouTube and podcasts.

I visit this site often to remind myself of what kind of person I want to be from moma's womb to tomb.

I also use this as an alternative to getting sucked into YouTube or another social media site or the news.
